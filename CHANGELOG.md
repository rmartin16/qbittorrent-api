- Persist a Requests Session between API calls instead of always creating a new one...small perf benefit
- Move auth endpoints back to a dedicated module
- Since ``attrdict`` is apparently going to break in Python 3.10 and it is no longer maintained, I've vendored a modified version (fixes #45)

### v2021.1.16 (26 jan 2021)

- New ``torrents/renameFile`` and ``torrents/renameFolder`` endpoints

### v2020.12.14 (6 dec 2020)
- Add support for non-standard API endpoint paths (Fixes #37)
- Allows users to leverage this client when qBittorrent is configured behind a reverse proxy
  - For instance, if the Web API is being exposed at "http://localhost/qbt/", then users can instantiate via ``Client(host='localhost/qbt')`` and all API endpoint paths will be prefixed with "/qbt"
- Additionally, the scheme (i.e. http or https) from the user will now be respected as the first choice for which scheme is used to communicate with qBittorrent
  - However, users still don't need to even specify a scheme; it'll be automatically determined on the first connection to qBittorrent
- Neither of these should be breaking changes, but if you're instantiating with an incorrect scheme or an irrelevant path, you may need to prevent doing that now
